## 📁 Open Source Projects
These are projects I've started or contributed to that hold a special place in my heart.

### [Raid.Exchange](https://github.com/Redmega/raid.exchange)
Built on Next.js & Supabase, raid.exchange helps Pokemon Scarlet & Violet players organize and plan their pokemon raids!

### [Mystery Express, Co](https://github.com/Redmega/mystery-express-co)
Built on Next.js & OpenAI's ChatGPT API, Mystery Express Co is a ChatGPT driven murder mystery game in the form of a detective's journal. A real life murder has occured on a murder mystery train, and it's up to the players to investigate various clues and interview suspects in order to find the perpetrator and bring them to justice!

The github readme has a lengthier write-up but it was a lot of fun integrating with OpenAI's API and figuring out the nuances of ChatGPT!

This project won First Overall at Major League Hacking's [**AI Hackfest**](https://ai-hackfest.devpost.com/) on May 14th, 2023.
